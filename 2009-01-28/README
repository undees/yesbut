This folder contains example code adapted for a testing-related
episode of the CocoaCast podcast (http://www.cocoacast.com). I've
taken one of the Mac samples from "Scripted GUI Testing With Ruby"
(http://pragprog.com/titles/idgtr) and translated it from classic
RSpec notation into the new Cucumber format.

Here's how to try out the code:

1) If you're not on Leopard, upgrade to a newer Ruby version, such as
   the one available at http://www.macports.org.

2) Install the libraries used by this example:

   sudo gem install cucumber rspec rb-appscript

3) Run the code:

   cucumber features

4) Explore the code.  Start with the features/*.feature files to see
   the intent of the tests.  These plain English descriptions of
   features just happen to be running code.  To see which pieces of
   Ruby code are run for each step of the test, look inside
   features/step_definitions/edit_definitions.rb.  The AppleScript
   definitions inside features/support/document.rb carry out the
   lower- level keyboard and mouse commands.
